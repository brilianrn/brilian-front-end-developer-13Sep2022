        graduated from Hacktiv8 Indonesia, in mid-May 2021, I was accepted to

        Health Indonesia as a Full Stack Developer in charge of developing and

        being responsible as a permanent employee, I also have experience
        working part time in several companies, namely in December 2021 I worked
